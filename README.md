# SPACE-the-game
It is the first game I have created in Unreal Engine. With my team (five friends), we finished this whole game in only 12 days. Due to time constraints, this was a challenging project for us but we pull it off even before the deadline (2 weeks).   I served as the project manager, team manager, and an unreal generalist. Most of the time, I worked on coding and UI, but I've also done some designing here and there.
